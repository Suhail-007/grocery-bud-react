#Grocery-Bud(React)

#### So what's different from the other grocery bud i have <a href="https://github.com/Suhail-007/Grocery-Bud.git">Grocery-Bud</a> in my github account? well this one is based on react and i added some transition too.

<p>i used react-toastify for toast and for icons i used react-icons.. Main functionality is handled by useReducer</p>.
